                        <h2>What is Hallyu?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <h3>The origin of Hallyu</h3>
                    <p>From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, South Korean TV dramas and popular music gained great
                        popularity in Asian countries such as China and Japan.<br>In 1997, when the TV drama entitled
                        What Is Love was aired by the Chinese major state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV),
                        it ranked second in China’s alltime imported video
                        content. Then, the term Hallyu or the “Korean Wave” first appeared, referring to the global
                        craze for Korean culture.<br>
                        The number of Hallyu-related organizations enthusiastic about Korean culture is on the rise.
                        Every year, the number of these organizations increases by 7% and the number of members by 36%.
                        As of 2020, the total
                        number of members who have
                        joined Hallyu-related organizations in all countries around the world have reached nearly 100
                        million. This is a five-fold increase over five years. The majority of them consist of K-pop fan
                        clubs such as ARMY, BTS’s global official
                        fan club, and BLINK, BLACKPINK’s official fan club.<br>In addition, other organizations and
                        communities are also active in various fields such as South Korean dramas, food, and
                        tourism. </p>

                        One area that is growing more rapidly than any other is 21st century K-pop, or Korean pop music,
                        which spans dance-pop,
                        pop ballads, techno, rock, hip-hop, R&B, and so on. K-pop is a generic term for popular music
                        from South Korea, which was originally called gayo, meaning pop music. Recently, the term “pop,”
                        which originally referred to British and American pop music, has been used to refer to popular
                        music in other countries by adding it to the first letter of the country’s name, like “K-pop” of
                        Korea. For example, popular music in Thailand, Japan, and China is called T-pop, J-pop,
                        and C-pop, respectively.<br>
                        In the same context, Korean pop music is called K-pop. The worldwide success of “Gangnam Style” was followed by a surge of K-pop boy group, BTS. BTS topped the Billboard 200
                        chart in 2019 and won the Top Social Artist award for the third consecutive year at the Billboard Music Awards. This
                        attracted attention from the world, resulting in the global recognition of K-pop as a genre.<br> After landing atop the
                        Billboard 200 chart in February 2020, “Map of the Soul: 7” maintained high rankings for 23 consecutive weeks. BTS has
                        achieved various Guinness World Records titles, including a title for most viewers for a music concert livestream. In
                        August 2020, BTS made history by becoming the first South Korean act to top the Billboard Hot 100 with its first
                        English-language song “Dynamite.”

                        healthy and delicious.
                        Certainly. Korean cuisine has a long history that is closely tied to the country's culture and geography. Korean food is
                        known for its use of a wide variety of ingredients and the balancing of flavors, such as sweet, sour, spicy, and salty.

                    <p>The cinema of South Korea has become a large market in the world, with the increasing global
                        success and globalization
                        of the Korean film industry.

                        Korea in 2018 was USD
                        1.6 billion out of the global film market of USD 41.1 billion, placing the value of South Korean
                        cinema at the fifth largest in the world following North America, China, Japan, and the United
                        Kingdom.
                        South Korea ranks first for attendance frequency per capita in the world, and Korean films take
                        51% of the local box offices. Films such as Old Boy, Oasis, Burning, and On the Beach at Night
                        Alone won leading awards in major categories. <br>

                        The Handmaiden, and Rotten Tomatoes, an American review-aggregation website for film and
                        television, spotlighted Poetry.
